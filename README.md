inventory
=========

The inventory module for cintranet.

This module is developed stand alone from cintranet, but it is expected to be used as part
of cintranet. If you want to just use this module on it's own, or as part of any other Django
project, that should be possible too.

The inventory_test folder included in this repo is a basic Django site to allow running this
module standalone to aid development.

Requirements
------------

* Python 2.7
* Django 1.6
* django-reversion 1.8
